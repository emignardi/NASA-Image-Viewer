# NASA Image Viewer (Final Project)

The NASA Image Viewer allows users to view images provided by NASA's API. Users will select a date on the Calendar and based on the date selected, a particular image will be displayed alongside further details about it. Options to navigate to the image through the browser and record deletion are also available.

The application utilizes a SQLite Database for persistence, an extended AsyncTask class to perform operations in the background, and a ListView/Adapter to display saved content to the user.
